# sensors-comunication
Android app to communicate between devices and get sensor data

# Usage
- First you need to have a Firebase project: http://console.firebase.com
- Set up your project with your Firebase details (put the json at the project, etc, just like Firebase tutorial says)
- You are able to use it! Remember to check the authentication permissions on Firebase. This project is made without any firebase authentication resources, it allows annonymous users to change data, but you can change this if you create an Activity to allow the user to sign up.
